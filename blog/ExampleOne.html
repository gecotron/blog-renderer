        <h1>Michael's Simple Funky Blogging Tool</h1>
        <h2>Or M.S.F.B.T. but that is unpronouncable</h2>
        <p>This is a simple blogging tool written in javascript, made to make writing a bunch of posts on a website easy, using a little bit of javascript, and the fetch api</p>
        <p>This tool is not perfect, so there are some bugs here and there. If you can help me fix them, that would be great, otherwise I will keep on working at it myself</p>
        <h1>How to use this tool</h1>
        <p>To start, take a look at the code in <a href="src/render.js">the renderer</a>. It is built of two main parts and two small ones.</p>
        <p>To get it to render your posts, append your blog post to the begining of the <u>bloglist array</u>. this will add your post to the top of the blog.</p>
